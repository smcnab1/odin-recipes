    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quidem, natus nobis beatae dolorem, nesciunt laudantium inventore vel quia nihil optio incidunt delectus aperiam consequatur odio sunt blanditiis ea atque quae!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
            <li>10 slices of streaky bacon</li>
            <li>150g haggis</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get two pieces of baking parchment ready, both the same size and about double the width of the chicken breast. Put one on a chopping board or surface with the chicken on top, and cover with the second piece of parchment. Using a rolling pin, bash the chicken breasts until they are around 3cm thick. Keep the baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Lay 5 rashers of streaky bacon horizontally on top of a piece of the reserved parchment. Lay the flattened chicken breast on top of the bacon vertically. Put up to 75g or a couple of tablespoons of haggis in the centre of the butterflied chicken breast, in a log shape. Repeat with the second chicken breast. Carefully roll each breast up as tightly as possible. Chill for at least 1 hr, or up to 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Carefully unwrap the chicken, making sure the bacon is still intact and the chicken is still tightly rolled with the seam-side down to hold the haggis in place. Tightly wrap in foil, then put on a baking tray and cook in the oven for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the oven, and leave to cool in the foil for a few minutes. Turn the oven up to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.</li>
            <li>Using heatproof gloves, carefully remove the foil, making sure none of the bacon comes off, and put the chicken back on a baking tray in the oven for 15 mins, or until the bacon is crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 mins before slicing and serving with the potato cakes, sauce and kale.</li>
        </ol>
