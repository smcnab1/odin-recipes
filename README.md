## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have:
- Gained practical experience in writing semantic HTML
- Learned how to structure a multi-page website
- Practised using relative paths for linking between pages and images
- Improved confidence using Git for version control

This project lays the groundwork for understanding how websites are built and structured, forming a solid base for moving on to CSS and JavaScript.
